# Azure-Based Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project leverages Azure's cloud-based solutions to perform data analysis on the AdventureWorksLT dataset. The project integrates Azure SQL Server for data storage, Azure Functions for API development, and Power BI for creating dynamic visualizations. The objective is to demonstrate a full-stack data analysis pipeline that can be used for business intelligence and decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Storage:** Utilized Azure SQL Server to manage and store the AdventureWorksLT dataset.
- **API Development:** Developed a scalable query API using Azure Functions to facilitate efficient data retrieval.
- **Data Visualization:** Created interactive and insightful reports using Power BI to visualize data trends and patterns.
- **Cloud Integration:** Ensured seamless integration of all components within the Azure ecosystem for optimal performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure SQL Server:** For storing and managing relational data.
- **Azure Functions:** To build a serverless API for querying the dataset.
- **Power BI:** For building dashboards and reports to visualize the data.
- **AdventureWorksLT Dataset:** A sample database used for the project.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- An active Azure account.
- Power BI Desktop installed on your machine.

### Steps

1. **Azure SQL Server:**

   - Deploy the AdventureWorksLT dataset to your Azure SQL Server instance.
   - Configure access permissions for the database.

2. **Azure Functions:**

   - Set up an Azure Functions app in the Azure portal.
   - Deploy your function code to the Azure Functions app to handle API requests.

3. **Power BI:**
   - Connect Power BI to your Azure SQL Server instance.
   - Import the data and create your visualizations.

## Usage

1. **Data Retrieval:**

   - Use the Azure Functions API to query specific data from the AdventureWorksLT dataset.
   - The API endpoints are designed to return data in JSON format.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Open the Power BI report to explore the visualizations and insights derived from the dataset.
   - Use filters and drill-down features to interact with the data.
